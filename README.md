# Covid-19 Voice Assistant
This a voice assistant to get the latest COVID-19 statistics around the world.

# Instructions
To run the voice assistant on your terminal, download the 'covid_info.py' and the 'reqirements.txt' file from my repository. Use your command prompt (terminal) to navigate to the place where you have downloaded the files and copy and run the following command:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Finally to talk to the voice assistant run the python file:

python3 covid_info.py

Wait for the program to respond, and you can ask for the total number of cases, deaths in the world or any particular country. To stop the program say STOP/END.
